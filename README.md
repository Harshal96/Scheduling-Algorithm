# Scheduling-Algorithm
The repository consists of the modified and unmodified scheduling algorithms for better performance than existing algorithms.

PreemtiveRoundRobinPriority is a modified algorithm based on the IEEE Paper published by me: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7955294/.

DynamicallyChangingTimeQuantum is a modified algorithm.

PreemtiveSJF is the pre-emtive version of Shortest Job First.

OTHDSA is an Optimised Two Head Disk Scheduling Algorithm.
